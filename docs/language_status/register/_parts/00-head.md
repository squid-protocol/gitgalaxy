# The oracle and its assumptions: where our COBOL side may differ from IBM z/OS

A proof here says one thing: **on these scenarios, the Java port gave the same outputs as the COBOL program run by
our oracle.** The oracle is GnuCOBOL 3.1.2 (`cobc -std=ibm -fsign=EBCDIC`), plus our own models of what GnuCOBOL
lacks: CICS (`tests/equivalence/cics/ggcics.c`), Db2's precompiler (`tests/tools/equivalence_sql.py`, over a real
Db2), Language Environment services (`tests/equivalence/le/`) and IBM's DISPLAY text (`tests/equivalence/faults/ggdisplay.c`).

So every claim rests on three links:

1. **IBM z/OS ≈ our oracle.** This document.
2. **Our oracle = the Java port**, on the scenarios run. The proofs.
3. **The scenarios exercise the program.** The coverage figures quoted with every proof.

Link 1 is the only one that no run of ours checks. This page lists every place we know or suspect it does not
hold, so that a claim can be quoted with its limits. A run on real z/OS would settle most entries; until then each
one is either made to match IBM's documentation, refused by name, or written down here.
