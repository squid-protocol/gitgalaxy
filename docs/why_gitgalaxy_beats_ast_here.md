# Where GitGalaxy's Signal Beats a Plain AST — and Where It Doesn't

`README.md`'s ["One Graph, Not Five Separate Tools"](../README.md#one-graph-not-five-separate-tools)
section is upfront about the general trade GitGalaxy makes: tree-sitter (and AST parsing in
general) is *more precise per file* than GitGalaxy's regex-based structural signatures, in
exchange for one comparable signal set across every language in a repo without a per-language
toolchain. That's still true as the general rule. This doc is about the one specific, measured
exception to it, so it doesn't get overstated into "GitGalaxy is more accurate than tree-sitter" —
it isn't, in general — or hidden because it's inconvenient for the general narrative.

## The specific claim

For counting a function's **arguments** in languages/idioms where the grammar has **no formal
parameter-list syntax at all**, GitGalaxy's body-aware regex signal produces a more useful number
than a plain AST/tree-sitter read of the declaration, because the declaration has nothing there to
read. This is narrow on purpose: it's one signal (`args`), in specific circumstances (no formal
signature exists), not a general claim about parsing quality.

## Plain-language version

Bash and traditional-style Perl don't have a "parameter list" the way Python, Java, or JavaScript
do. `quiet_cd()` in bash and `sub foo { }` in Perl are permanently, structurally zero-argument as
far as the formal grammar is concerned — that's not a parsing gap, it's just what the language
looks like. A real function still takes real inputs, though: bash reads them out of `$1`, `$2`,
`"$@"` inside the function body; traditional Perl reads them out of `my ($x, $y) = @_;` or a
`shift` call, also inside the body.

A tool that only looks at the declaration (a plain AST walk asking "does this function node have a
parameters field") finds nothing for either of these and correctly reports 0 — correct, because
there genuinely is no formal signature, but useless as a coupling/complexity signal, since it
reports 0 for every single such function regardless of how many arguments it actually consumes.

GitGalaxy's `args` structural signature reads the function's *body* instead of its declaration,
using the same idiom a human reading the code would: how many distinct `$N` positions does this
bash function reference? How many variables does that `my (...) = @_` line unpack? That produces a
real, differentiated number per function — exactly the kind of signal risk-scoring and coupling
analysis need, and exactly what a declaration-only AST read cannot produce here because the
information was never in the declaration to begin with.

## The evidence

This started as a measurement bug, not a marketing claim, and the fix is what makes the claim
checkable. `tests/tools/tree_sitter_accuracy_audit.py` grades GitGalaxy's `args` signal against
tree-sitter's own parse as ground truth — but its original `_get_param_count` only ever checked
the declaration node for a formal parameter field, the same declaration-only view a plain AST tool
would use. For shell and perl that made the "ground truth" itself blind to the same body idiom
GitGalaxy was reading, so the comparison was comparing GitGalaxy's real signal against an
artificially empty baseline:

| Language | Before (ground truth = declaration only) | After (ground truth = body-aware, same idiom GitGalaxy reads) |
|---|---|---|
| shell | 0% (0/3) | **100% (3/3)** |
| perl | 14.6% (137/937) | **82.1% (769/937)** |

The fix (`_count_shell_real_positional_max` / `_count_perl_real_args` in the audit tool) makes the
*ground truth* walk the same body text for the same idiom, using tree-sitter's own real parse (it
parses `$1`/`my (...) = @_`/`shift` fine — nothing here requires a special grammar). Once both
sides are asked the same question, they agree almost all of the time. The residual gap in each
case is documented in the tool's own module docstring (`tests/tools/tree_sitter_accuracy_audit.py`,
`#1518`/`#1519`) — mostly a known, hard-to-fix-without-real-scope-tracking case where a nested
anonymous Perl sub's own `my (...) = @_` gets counted as if it belonged to the outer sub, since a
flat regex scan has no real block-nesting awareness. Not hidden, just not chased further yet.

## Where this does NOT apply

- Any language with real formal parameter-list syntax (Python, Java, Rust, Go, JavaScript, most
  of the 31 languages this tool baselines) — there, tree-sitter's declaration-based ground truth
  *is* the fair comparison, and a GitGalaxy/tree-sitter mismatch there is a real GitGalaxy
  precision bug to fix, not a "different question" situation. See the six prior fixes in this same
  file's docstring (solidity #1503, tcl #1504, haskell #1505/#1511, ruby #1506) — those were all
  real bugs, found and fixed the normal way.
- Modern Perl 5.20+ explicit signatures (`sub foo($x, $y) { ... }`) — these DO have a real formal
  parameter list, and both GitGalaxy and the ground truth already prefer it over the body-idiom
  fallback when present.
- Function *recall/precision* (finding the right set of functions at all) — this doc is
  specifically about the `args` (parameter count) signal, not `func_start`/`class_start` accuracy,
  where tree-sitter's grammar-based approach is the straightforwardly better ground truth.

## Where this is used

- README.md's "One Graph, Not Five Separate Tools" section links here as the one narrow exception
  to its general "AST usually wins on precision" framing.
- `tests/tools/tree_sitter_accuracy_audit.py`'s own module docstring cites this doc next to the
  `#1518`/`#1519` writeup, so a future reader hitting the shell/perl ground-truth code understands
  why it looks structurally different from every other language's branch in `_get_param_count`.
